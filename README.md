# GitHub `.mailmap` test
Repository for monitoring when GitHub starts considering entries in the .mailmap file when showing authors / contributors.

As long as the author of the commit above and/or the main contributor is shown to be "Wrong name", GitHub didn't do this properly.


I created this repo because there is conflicting and possibly outdated information about this on the internet:
* This SO question indicates that the `.mailmap` file should be considered: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53629125
* This GitHub community discussion from 2019 indicates it doesn't work yet, but there is "an open feature request": https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/22518
